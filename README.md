# Breast_Cancer_Classification_Using_Logistic_Regression
This project demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be used to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on various features. The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which includes features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and others, extracted from digitized images of breast masses.

The primary goal of this project is to build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using these features. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curves.
